# Simple chat application that show messages in dialects: 

## Ruby version - 2.4

* Configuration
This is a rails 5 application, using ActionCable for websockets communication. 

* Database creation
Run "rails db:setup" / "rails db:reset" to create the database, create the table and load the seed files. 

* How to run the test suite
Rspec ./spec should run all the tests. Right now the tests are mostly limited to the messages_controller due to lack of time.
